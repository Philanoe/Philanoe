- 👋 Hi, I’m @Philanoe
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and automation in general
- 🌱Being aware of the need for ecology, I am trying to reduce the environmental impact of my scripts (less data transfer, light computing, etc) and would like to work on environnment-friendly programming.
- 💞️ I’m currently teaching Artificial Intelligence and working on 3D reconstruction projects.
